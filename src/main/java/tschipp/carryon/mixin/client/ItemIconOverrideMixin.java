 * Injects into ItemRenderer.renderItem to completely suppress the default

 *
 * Third-person block rendering is handled by BlockRendererLayer (called from
 * PlayerRendererMixin.renderSpecials). If we let renderItem also run, it draws
 * a sprite quad on top of / around the block, causing the "stray texture" bleed.
 *
 * First-person rendering is already cancelled in FirstPersonMixin, so this mixin
 * only needs to guard the third-person path (renderItem called from RenderPlayer).
